""" The global consts file

Some constant values are being used across multiple parts of the application.
A good example is the size of an entry in our UI.
If we wouldn't have this Consts.py file,
every time we will want to change the size of an entry,
we will need to do it in more than 10 different places.
a good practice is to define such constants once inside a file,
and consume it from your different application parts
